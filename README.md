## Stock Market Prediction with ARIMA

This repository showcases an in-depth analysis of stock market data using various techniques for data evaluation and forecasting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on stock market data, focusing on daily closing prices to uncover patterns and insights.

### Statistical Tests

- Applied the Hypothesis test to validate assumptions and investigate data relationships.
- Utilized the Dickey-Fuller test to assess the presence of unit roots in the data, which indicates non-stationarity.
- Generated ACF/PACF plots to identify potential lags and correlations in the data.
- Employed the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity and reveal underlying trends or seasonality.

### Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

- Utilized ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) Time Series Analysis to forecast the stock's price movement over the next 10 days.
- Leveraged insights from EDA and results from statistical tests to build a reliable ARIMA model for predicting future stock prices.
